Here you will found the main uses for modal verbs in English and some examples about them.

#### HAVE TO, MUST AND SHOULD

First, We're going to start reviewing **modal verbs of obligation:**

What is the difference between **have to (external obligation**) and **must (internal obligation)**?

* An **external obligation** is something that doesn't come from yourself but from an external factor
* An **internal obligation** is something that you do on your own because is something that you need to do

#### CAN AND COULD

Then We have **moval verbs of possibilities**:

I know that maybe you are thinking **"what is the difference between can and could?"**

**The answer is very simple:** 

* We use **"could"** to show that something is possible, **but no certain**
* We use **"can"** to make general statements about **what is possible**

#### **MAY AND MIGHT**

We use them to express possibilities about something that can happen or could happen, but We don't have certainty about it.

What are the differences between **may** and **might**?

* **May**

  **\-** May should be used when you are talking about a **possible event** or and event that could be **factual**.

  **\-** May is the verb in the present tense.
* **Might**

  **\-** Might refers to events that are **hypothetical** or possible but **very unlikely**.

  **\-** Might is the same verb but in the **past tense.**
