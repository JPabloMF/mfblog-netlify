In this post, you will learn how to create a snippet for your React function component

Let's do it:

1. You need to go to File > Preferences > User Snippets
2. Then choose the snippet called ***jsx.code-snippets*** or something similar with the ***jsx*** prefix
3. If you don't have this option let's create it clicking in the ***New Snippets*** option
4. Then assign it a name, I recommend you name it ***jsx***



```json
{
  "basic jsx component": {
    "prefix": "component",
    "body": [
      "import React from 'react';",
      "import PropTypes from 'prop-types';",
      "$0",
      "const ${1:name} = (props) => {",
      "\t$0return(",
      "\t$0\t$0<div>${1:name}</div>",
      "\t$0);",
      "};",
      "$0",
      "${1:name}.propTypes = {",
      "\tprops: PropTypes.object.isRequired",
      "};",
      "$0",
      "export default ${1:name};"
    ],
    "description": "Create a basic jsx component structure"
  }
}

```

And that's it! âœ¨

Now you can go to any jsx file and type **component** and then **press tab**, and you will create a function component instantly.

```javascript
import React from 'react';

const name = (props) => {
  return(
  	<div></div>
  );
}

export default name;
```
