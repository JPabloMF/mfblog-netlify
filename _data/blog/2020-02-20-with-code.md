In this post, you will learn how to create a snippet for your React function component

Let's do it:

1. You need to go to File > Preferences > User Snippets
2. Then choose the snippet called ***jsx.code-snippets*** or something similar with the ***jsx*** prefix
3. If you don't have this option let's create it clicking in the ***New Snippets*** option
4. Then assign it a name, I recommend you name it ***jsx***

```javascript
import React from 'react';

const name = (props) => {
  return(
  	<div></div>
  );
}

export default name;
```
